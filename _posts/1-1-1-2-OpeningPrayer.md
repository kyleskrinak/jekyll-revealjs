## Opening prayer

_7:00 - 7:05_

--- 

Divine one, we thank you for those whom you inspired to preserve and pass down the story of our salvation. As we enter into the Bible, help us to see and embrace the spiritual truths contained within. May our study, prayer, and immersion in the Gospel message bring us closer to you and your Son, Jesus, through the power of your Holy Spirit.

Amen
